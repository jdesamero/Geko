// the loaded template is handled by Geko_Wp_Bootstrap::templateInclude()
// which overrides apply_filters( 'template_include', $template )
// it includes the template file (eg: homepage.php) since it's a class file
// $template is then set to this file so that the class/template file is not loaded multiple times
