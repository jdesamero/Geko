<h4>Add A Location</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
Add a location or two via the <a href="<?php echo admin_url();?>admin.php?page=slp_add_locations">Add Location form</a>.
You will find this link, and other Store Locator Plus links, in the left sidebar under the "Store Locator Plus" entry.
If you have many locations to add, check out the <a href="http://www.charlestonsw.com/product-category/slplus/" target="csa">Pro Pack</a> and the bulk import options.
</p>

<h4>Create A Page</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
Go to the sidebar and select "Add New" under the pages section.  You will be creating a standard WordPress page.
On that page add the [SLPLUS] shortcode.  When a visitor goes to that page it will show a default search form and a Google Map.
When someone searches for a zip code that is close enough to a location you entered it will show those locations on the map.

<h4>Tweak The Settings</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
You can modify basic settings such as the options shown on the radius pull down list on the <a href="<?php echo admin_url();?>admin.php?page=slp_map_settings">Map Settings</a> page.
Even more settings are available via <a href="http://www.charlestonsw.com/product-category/slplus/" target="csa">the premium add-on packs</a>.
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>It is strongly recommended that you start by going to map settings and turning OFF "Force Load JavaScript".</strong>&nbsp; 
That settings appears in the map section under "Features, Look and Feel".    It is on by default because 20% of the WordPress themes on the market
do not properly support WordPress 3.3 standard page footer processing and thus break Store Locator Plus functionality.   Since many users will not
read this section it is ON be default.   It makes ALL of your pages load a little slower.  It also means that some features like the extended
shortcode attributes in the base plugin, as well as some of the premium add-on packs, will not function.    If your theme breaks the Store Locator Plus
plugin when you turn off Force Load JavaScript, write to the theme author and ask them to read the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script" target="csa">WordPress Codex on how to support wp_footer(), specifically in relation to wp_enqueue_script()</a>.
