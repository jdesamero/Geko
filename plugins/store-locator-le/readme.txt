If you are a plugin developer you will be interested in the new "Roll Your Own" program where you can create SLP based premium (or free) add-ons of your own.
Create something great and list it on the CSA site!

= Support =

Support for the plugin can be found in the [CSA Forums](http://www.charlestonsw.com/forums/).  If you have an urgent issue or want one-on-one support you can [purchase premium support](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/product-support).

You can also view the [CSA Product Documentation](http://www.charlestonsw.com/support/documentation) for more information about the plugin including [known conflicts](http://www.charlestonsw.com/support/documentation/technical-documentation/store-locator-plus/troubleshooting/known-conflicts/) with themes and plugins.

= Special Requests =

I accept feature requests for all plugins. The most requested features will make it into the next version if time permits.

If you need something NOW, or are looking for something beyond a basic "tweak" of the plugin, please check out the
[Customization Service](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/customization/).  

= Upgrades and Patches =

I try to release at least one upgrade/patch every month.

The main product will always remain fully functional and free.
If you'd like to have some of the latest "bells & whistles" purchasing a premium add-on is a great way to help support me and encourage even more items get added the next time around.

= My Philosophy =

I strive to create code that runs efficiently and without bugs.
In my opinion, well-written plugins are few and far between.
While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, far too many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have too many hidden problems.
I have found that over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when you turn off the "hide all the problems" settings.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance via the typical default logging settings.
While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked.
The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During 20+ years of software development, I have found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road.
Warnings today often become errors tomorrow.
Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near all those warning messages.
Some warnings are telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow".
Eventually tomorrow will come.

While my plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, I do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be.
My code is not perfect, but when I find a bug I try to fix it fast. 
If I create a bug I try to fix it even faster.
To sum it all up, I like to write plugins that last.
I hope you appreciate my work.

= Rate This Plugin =

Please [rate this plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/store-locator-le/)!
Rating the plugin, hopefully with 5 stars, helps increase the exposure on WordPress, which generates more downloads and purchases of add-ons.
The more add-ons I sell the easier it is to put food on the table and give me more time to code cool new features.
No ratings, no food, more hours working as the Walmart Greeter, less coolness in the plugins.

Give me a chance to address your concerns if this plugin doesn't earn 5 stars by [contacting me](http://www.charlestonsw.com/mindset/contact-us/) directly or by posting in the [support forum](http://www.charlestonsw.com/forums/) at the CSA website.

= Help Me "Speak" Your Language =

Help me with translating the English words and phrases in the plugin and I will give you a premium add-on or plugin.
I will send you the translation files that WordPress creates, you send back the translation, I add any requested premium add-on to your account.
[Contact me](http://www.charlestonsw.com/mindset/contact-us/) to request the files and let me know which language you want to translate.
Offer available to first complete translation of this plugin or for notable updates to existing translation files.
Upon request I will also put a link to your site in the "special thanks" section.

Any EASIER way to help with translations?  Load the (Codestyling Localization plugin)[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/] and then find it under "Tools/Localization" in your admin panel.

Here is the process, in case you are wondering:
1. I run php makepot.php for the plugin.
2. I send you a csa-slplus.pot file similar to [this one](http://wp.me/a36f2N-2aA).
3. You send me back a po file named after the specific locale such as csa-slplus-es_MX.po
4. I generate the .mo file for that locale with the msgfmt -o filename.mo filename.po command.
5. I ship the pot, po, and mo files in the next release.
6. Users see your translation text when their WordPress install is setup for the matching locale.
7. You tell me which premium plugin or add-on pack that I created that you would like to have.
8. The world is a happier place, especially for my friends that have as much trouble reading English as I do just about any other language!

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* PHP 5.2.4+ (same as WordPress 3.3.2)
* WordPress: 3.3.2+

= Main Plugin =

1. Search for "Store Locator Plus" via Plugins/Add New on your WordPress admin panel.
2. Click install.
3. Add your locations through the 'Add Locations' page in the Store Locator admin panel
4. Create or edit a page and add the [SLPLUS] shortcode.

= Icons =

The system ships with a dozen default icons in the `/wp-content/plugins/store-locator-le/core/images/icons` directory. Add your own custom icons in that directory and they will be auto-detected.

To prevent custom icons from being over-written they will be copies to the '/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-icons/' directory.  If you place your icons in that directory they will be detected on the icon selection screens.

= Custom Styling =

Users that want to customize the look and feel of the search form, map, and search results can do so
with ease using the new Theme System that is part of the Pro Pack.   Copy an existing CSS file,
change the file name and update the CSS header, upload to the server and you can now activate your
new theme or any of the built-in defaults by selecting it from the auto-generated pulldown menu.

Users that opt not to purchase the Pro Pack can still customize the look by editing the basic CSS file that ships with the free plugin.

= Special Thanks =

Thank you, [Jan de Baat](www.de-baat.nl), for the Dutch translation.

Thanks to [Nicolas Mollet](http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com/) and Icons-Land (http://www.icons-land.com/) via Icon Finder for some of the great icons.

[Massive Creative](http://www.massivecreativeinc.com) for some of our banners and other creative work.

Thanks to [Google](http://www.google.com) for the maps engine as well as some of the icons.  Some of the Google open-source icons are found [at this unofficial list](http://www.visual-case.it/cgi-bin/vc/GMapsIcons.pl).

Thanks to "PennyGrit" for pointing out security issues so I can patch them before the exploit gets into the wild.

efficient as possible for everyone else.   It also provides a great way to support future development while getting a
"little something extra" when contributing to my efforts.
